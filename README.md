```

## 🔍 Spot Check Interpretation

### ✅ PASSED - Excellent!
```
✅ PASSED: Followers increased by 10!
```
**Meaning:** All or more users followed you back. Perfect scenario!

### ⚠️ PARTIAL - Normal
```
⚠️ PARTIAL: Only 7 of 10 followers added
```
**Meaning:** Some users followed back. This is completely normal!
- 60-80% follow-back rate is excellent
- 40-60% follow-back rate is good
- 20-40% follow-back rate is acceptable

**Why Not 100%?**
- Some users are inactive
- Some don't check notifications
- Some are selective about following back
- Takes time for mutual follows to reflect

### ❌ FAILED - Needs Attention
```
❌ FAILED: No follower increase detected
```
**Meaning:** No one followed back yet.

**Common Reasons:**
1. **Too Soon** - Wait 1-2 hours and check again
2. **API Delay** - GitHub's counter updates slowly
3. **Inactive Users** - Target list has inactive accounts
4. **Account Restrictions** - Your account may be flagged
5. **Profile Issues** - Improve your profile to encourage follows

## ⚙️ Rate Limit Explained

### GitHub API Limits

| Limit Type | Amount | Reset Period |
|------------|--------|--------------|
| Authenticated Requests | 5,000/hour | Every hour |
| Secondary Rate Limit | Varies | 1 minute to several hours |

### How This Script Handles Limits

1. **Detection:**
   - Monitors `X-RateLimit-Remaining` header
   - Catches 403 Forbidden errors
   - Detects rate limit messages

2. **Automatic Wait:**
   - Reads `X-RateLimit-Reset` timestamp
   - Calculates exact wait time needed
   - Adds 1-minute buffer for safety
   - Defaults to 30 minutes if no timestamp

3. **Smart Resume:**
   - Automatically continues after wait
   - Retries the same user that failed
   - No data loss or skipped users

4. **User Control:**
   - Press Ctrl+C anytime to stop
   - Safe interruption during wait
   - Current progress is preserved

### What Triggers Rate Limits?

- **Too Many Follows**: More than ~50 follows/hour
- **Too Fast**: Less than 1 second between follows
- **Burst Activity**: Many requests in short time
- **Account Age**: New accounts have stricter limits
- **Previous Violations**: Past rate limit issues

### Avoiding Rate Limits

1. **Pace Yourself:**
   ```
   First hour:  30-40 follows
   Second hour: 40-50 follows
   Third hour:  50-60 follows
   ```

2. **Use Delays:**
   - Script has built-in 0.5s delay
   - Can increase to 1-2s for safety
   - Spot checks add 3s pause

3. **Spread Over Days:**
   ```
   Day 1: 100 follows
   Day 2: 150 follows
   Day 3: 200 follows
   ```

4. **Run During Off-Peak:**
   - Weekday mornings (US time)
   - Avoid Friday/Saturday evenings
   - GitHub has less load = more lenient limits

## 🛠️ Configuration Options

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem #1: Unauthorized Error

**Symptom:**
```
(1/100) Following: username ... Unauthorized. Check your ACCESS_TOKEN.
```

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Verify token is correct (no extra spaces)
2. ✅ Check token has `user:follow` permission
3. ✅ Ensure token hasn't expired
4. ✅ Regenerate token if needed
5. ✅ Test token: `curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user`

### Problem #2: Can't Perform Action

**Symptom:**
```
⚠️ Error: 'You can't perform that action at this time.' detected.
```

**Meaning:** GitHub has restricted your account temporarily.

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait 24 Hours:** Most restrictions auto-lift
2. **Check Account Status:** Visit https://github.com/settings/account
3. **Review Recent Activity:** Stop any suspicious automation
4. **Contact Support:** If restriction persists after 48 hours
5. **New Account?** Wait for account to mature (1-2 weeks)

### Problem #3: User Not Found (404)

**Symptom:**
```
(5/100) Following: badusername ... User not found.
```

**Meaning:** Username doesn't exist or user deleted account.

**Solutions:**
- ✅ Normal occurrence, script continues automatically
- ✅ Clean your user list of invalid usernames
- ✅ Verify usernames at: https://github.com/username

### Problem #4: Rate Limit Not Auto-Waiting

**Symptom:**
Script stops instead of waiting.

**Solutions:**
1. Check internet connection is stable
2. Verify you're using latest script version
3. Look for error messages before stop
4. Check `X-RateLimit-Reset` in headers
5. Manual wait then rerun script

### Problem #5: No Follower Increase

**Symptom:**
All spot checks show 0 gain.

**Investigation Steps:**

1. **Wait Longer:**
   ```bash
   # Wait 30 minutes, then check
   curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user | grep followers
   ```

2. **Manual Verification:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME?tab=followers
   - Check if new followers appear

3. **Check Target Users:**
   - Are they active? (commits in last 30 days)
   - Do they have many followers? (more likely to follow back)
   - Are they in your niche? (better engagement)

4. **Improve Your Profile:**
   - Add profile picture
   - Write compelling bio
   - Pin best repositories
   - Show recent activity

### Problem #6: Script Crashes

**Symptom:**
```
Unexpected error: [error message]
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check File Exists:**
   ```bash
   ls -la users.txt
   ```

2. **Check File Encoding:**
   ```bash
   file users.txt  # Should be UTF-8
   ```

3. **Verify Python Version:**
   ```bash
   python --version  # Should be 3.6+
   ```

4. **Check Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip list | grep requests
   ```

5. **Run with Debug:**
   ```bash
   python -u f.py users.txt 2>&1 | tee output.log
   ```

## 📈 Best Practices

### 1. Start Small and Scale

**Week 1: Testing Phase**
```
Day 1: 10-20 follows   (test run)
Day 2: 30-40 follows   (monitor results)
Day 3: 50-60 follows   (check spot checks)
```

**Week 2: Ramp Up**
```
Day 1: 75 follows
Day 2: 100 follows
Day 3: 150 follows
Day 4: 200 follows
```

**Week 3+: Full Speed**
```
Daily: 200-300 follows
Weekly: ~1,500 follows
Monthly: ~6,000 follows
```

### 2. Optimize Your Profile First

**Before Following Anyone:**
- ✅ Professional profile picture
- ✅ Clear, compelling bio
- ✅ Pin 6 best repositories
- ✅ Complete profile README
- ✅ Recent commit activity
- ✅ Starred repositories
- ✅ Contributions visible

**Profile Score Self-Check:**
```
0-2 completed: Poor (fix before following!)
3-4 completed: Fair (improve first)
5-6 completed: Good (ready to follow)
7+ completed: Excellent (maximum success)
```

### 3. Target the Right Users

**Good Targets:**
- Active in last 30 days
- Work in your tech stack
- 100-5,000 followers (sweet spot)
- Contribute to projects you like
- Similar location/timezone
- Open to networking (bio mentions "DMs open" etc.)

**Avoid:**
- Inactive (no commits in 6+ months)
- Celebrities (>50k followers)
- Organizations (don't follow back)
- Bots and fake accounts
- Users with 0 repositories

**How to Find Good Users:**

1. **From Popular Repos:**
   ```
   Go to popular repo → Insights → Contributors
   Copy usernames of active contributors
   ```

2. **From GitHub Search:**
   ```
   Search: "location:USA language:Python followers:100..5000"
   Browse users and collect usernames
   ```

3. **From Followers of Influencers:**
   ```
   Go to tech influencer → Followers tab
   Filter for active users
   Collect usernames
   ```

### 4. Monitor Your Results

**Daily Check:**
```bash
# Check your follower count
curl -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" https://api.github.com/user | grep followers

# Or visit
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME?tab=followers
```

**Weekly Analysis:**
```
Week 1: Followed 500, gained 200 = 40% rate ✅
Week 2: Followed 700, gained 350 = 50% rate ✅✅
Week 3: Followed 900, gained 270 = 30% rate ⚠️
```

If rate drops significantly:
- Review target list quality
- Check if you're hitting limits too often
- Verify profile is still appealing
- Adjust strategy

### 5. Maintain Your Account

**Daily:**
- Make at least 1 commit
- Star 2-3 interesting repos
- Check notifications

**Weekly:**
- Write/update documentation
- Open or comment on issues
- Review pull requests
- Update profile README

**Monthly:**
- Launch new project
- Write blog post/gist
- Engage with community
- Clean up old repos

### 6. Be Patient and Consistent

**Follow-Back Timeline:**
```
Immediately:    5-10% follow back
Within 1 hour:  20-30% follow back
Within 24 hrs:  50-70% follow back
Within 1 week:  80-90% follow back
After 1 month:  Maximum follow-backs received
```

**Long-Term Strategy:**
```
Month 1: Focus on building profile + 500 follows
Month 2: Consistent activity + 1,000 follows
Month 3: Engage with community + 1,500 follows
Month 6: Established presence + 3,000 total follows
Month 12: Recognized contributor + 5,000+ followers
```

## 🔒 Security & Safety

### Token Security

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep token private
- ✅ Use environment variables
- ✅ Add to .gitignore
- ✅ Regenerate if exposed
- ✅ Use minimal permissions

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Commit to public repos
- ❌ Share in chat/email
- ❌ Use tokens from others
- ❌ Give excessive permissions
- ❌ Use same token everywhere

### Environment Variable Method

**Linux/Mac:**
```bash
# Set token
export GITHUB_TOKEN='ghp_your_token_here'

# Run script (modify f.py to read from env)
python f.py users.txt

# Add to ~/.bashrc for persistence
echo "export GITHUB_TOKEN='ghp_your_token_here'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
set GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_token_here
python f.py users.txt
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN='ghp_your_token_here'
python f.py users.txt
```

**Modify Script to Use Environment Variable:**
```python
import os

ACCESS_TOKEN = os.getenv('GITHUB_TOKEN', 'YOUR API KEY')
```

### Account Safety

**Follow Limits (Conservative):**
```
New Account (<30 days):   50-100/day max
Young Account (30-90 days): 100-200/day max
Mature Account (90+ days):  200-400/day max
Established Account (1+ year): 400-600/day max
```

**Warning Signs:**
- Multiple "can't perform action" errors
- Followers not increasing at all
- Unable to access certain features
- Email from GitHub support

**If You Get Restricted:**
1. Stop all automation immediately
2. Wait 24-48 hours
3. Use GitHub normally (browse, star, etc.)
4. Don't follow anyone manually for 48 hours
5. Contact support if restriction persists

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Is this safe to use?
**A:** Yes, when used responsibly. Follow GitHub's rate limits, don't follow too many users too quickly, and maintain normal account activity.

### Q: Will I get banned?
**A:** Not if you use reasonable limits. Start with 50-100 follows/day and gradually increase. Many users use similar tools without issues.

### Q: Why doesn't everyone follow back?
**A:** Most users don't auto-follow back. 30-50% follow-back rate is normal and good. 70%+ is exceptional.

### Q: How long does it take to see results?
**A:** Most follow-backs happen within 24 hours. Some take up to a week. Be patient!

### Q: Can I run this 24/7?
**A:** Technically yes, but not recommended. Better to run 2-3 hours per day spread over multiple sessions.

### Q: What if script stops during rate limit wait?
**A:** You can restart it later. Already-followed users will be skipped automatically.

### Q: Should I unfollow users who don't follow back?
**A:** Personal choice. Many successful accounts follow thousands while having fewer followers. Quality of followers matters more than ratio.

### Q: How to get better follow-back rates?
**A:** Optimize your profile, target active users in your niche, engage with their content, and be patient.

### Q: What's the maximum followers I can gain per day?
**A:** Realistically, 50-150 new followers per day is excellent. 200+ per day is exceptional.

### Q: Does time of day matter?
**A:** Yes! Following during target audience's active hours (9 AM - 5 PM their timezone) gets better results.
